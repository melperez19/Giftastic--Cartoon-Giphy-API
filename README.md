This app displays buttons related to a certain topic (in this case, I chose cartoon shows) and allows you to add search terms to generate additional buttons that when clicked, accesses the GIPHY API and generates 10 static GIPHY images, along with the show ratings and image titles. Clicking on an image to will pause or play the GIF.
